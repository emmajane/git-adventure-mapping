Git for Teams Design Decisions - Presentation Repository
========================================================

Let's face it, everyone can punch some commands into Git and make things go splat. That's the easy part. Understanding *why* and *when* to apply various commands is the hard part of learning to be an effective Git team player. This session will briefly cover the four most important factors that will determine your project's success in working with Git:

- Repository architecture -- files to include, and omit
- Common branching patterns -- what they are, and how to choose one
- Access control -- the best hosting platforms to meet your needs
- Maintenance strategies -- how to keep your local repository up-to-date

This session is not a step-by-step command line tutorial. It is a high level overview of the decisions your team (including teams of one!) will need to make decisions on to be effective at using Git. Occasionally a command or two will be referenced, so those with some familiarity of version control will be best equipped to learn from this session.
